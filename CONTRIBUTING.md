_To contribute, or not to contribute, that is the question!_

**Hey there! The future contributor of this lovely project.**

I'm sure you will find it quite easy to contribute to the project. You will find step-by-step instructions down below to make it even more easier for you to contribute. 

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

### Instructions

Throughout the instructions, I will use the **Tailwind CSS** resource as an example.

#### 1. Updating the README.md file

Open the `README.md` file in your code editor and find the proper section for your resource. Enter the required information as in the example below. **You must enter the new resource in alphabetical order in the list.**

    - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

#### 2. Updating the related data file

Navigate to the `data` folder and open the related section's yaml file in your code editor (in our example it's the `frontend-design.yaml` file) and add the resource here one more time as in the below example.

**You need to enter the information in alphabetical order in the list** and the `title`, `description`, and `link` rows must be in the exact order as in the example below.

    - title: Tailwind CSS
      description: Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
      link: https://tailwindcss.com/

#### 3. Stick to the convention for commit message
The commit message must include the **resource name** and the **resource section name** as in the example below.

    Add [Tailwind CSS] --> [Frontend Design]
    

Well, that's all you need to know. It was easy, isn't is?
